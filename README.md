# Advent of Code

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

This repository houses my solutions for the 2018 Advent of Code event. See https://adventofcode.com/ for more information.

## Motivation

I use Advent of Code mostly to get familiar with languages which I have always wanted to learn or experiment with but never had a specific project in mind for. This is a fun way to keep up with modern languages that I don't get to use in my day to day life!
